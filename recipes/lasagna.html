    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <img src="../images/1024px-Lasagne_-_stonesoup.jpg" alt="Portion of lasagna served on a plate">
    
    <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. 
        In Italian cuisine it is made of stacked layers of pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients for 4 people:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g sheets ready for lasagna</li>
        <li>400g bechamel</li>
        <li>grated parmigiano</li>
        <li>150g diced pancetta</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk</li>
        <li>500g minced beef</li>
        <li>200ml red wine</li>
        <li>400g tomato puree</li>
        <li>200ml milk</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preparation of Bolognese sauce.</li>
        <li>Add celery, carrot and onion and fry for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced meat and mix to distribute it evenly.</li>
        <li>After 5 minutes, add the wine and continue cooking for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato puree and season with salt and pepper, giving it a good stir.</li>
        <li>Cook over a very low heat for at least an hour and a half with the lid on, to thicken our ragù.</li>
        <li>Pour the milk into the pan and finish cooking for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the ragù is ready, you can assemble the lasagna: place a few spoonfuls of ragù on the bottom of an oven-proof dish.</li>
        <li>Place a lasagne sheet on top and cover with more ragù.</li>
        <li>Lasciamo scivolare sul ragù qualche cucchiaio di besciamella.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with a handful of grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with another sheet of pastry and repeat: ragù, béchamel, grated cheese. In the last layer we can abound with both the béchamel and the cheese.</li>
        <li>Place in the oven and cook in a preheated oven at 180°C for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>We take it out of the oven, wait a few minutes for it to settle and then we serve our lasagna Bolognese nice and steaming hot!</li>
