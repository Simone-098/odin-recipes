# odin-recipes
The Odin Project's first practical project, covering the fundamentals of HTML.

The aim of the project is to create a simple structure with a main page that hosts links that direct to the pages of some recipes in which they are present: title, image of the dish, short description, list of ingredients, steps ordered to execute the recipe.

From each recipe page it will then be possible to return to the Homepage.
